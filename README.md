# DotFiles

This repository contains bash aliases, prompts and other configs I use.

### Install

Symlink `bashrc` to `.bashrc` and rest of the configs will be done automatically.

```sh
ln -s ./bashrc ~/.bashrc
```

If you want to make the aliases and other configs available to root, do the following.

```sh
ln -s /path/to/dotfiles/bashrc /root/.bashrc
```

But be aware about security issues.
